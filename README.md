# Binary Search Tree Implementation

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with various functionalities including insertion, deletion, traversal, and balancing. The tree is built from an array of data, and operations are performed to maintain and manage the tree efficiently.

## Features

- **Node Class**: Represents each node in the tree with the following attributes:

  - `data`: Value stored in the node
  - `left`: Left child node
  - `right`: Right child node

- **Tree Class**: Manages the BST, including:
  - Building a balanced tree from an array
  - Inserting and deleting nodes
  - Traversing the tree in level-order, in-order, pre-order, and post-order
  - Checking if the tree is balanced and rebalancing it
  - Finding a node by value
  - Calculating the height and depth of nodes
